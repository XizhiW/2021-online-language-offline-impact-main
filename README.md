In this project, I am taking the part to extract the locations of posts and convert them into readable text
I applied spaCy models to extract toponymy information from Facebook posts, it was a pretrained model specialized in extracting places entities from a sentence or a paragraph. Then by introducing a geocoder (Nominatim), the toponymy information were converted into a readable and easy to process format so that my teammates can do statistical analysis on them. The project was about studying peopleâ€™s reaction on major social events and how it was spread around the Facebook networks.
